    "instruction": "We will give you a sequence of scRNA transcriptomics data of a single cell. We would like to predict the age of the cell based on the gene name. The age is usually decided by combination of genes. The following are the gene names (Genes), gender (Gender), cell type (Class), and organ (Tissue), separated by the keywords Genes, Gender, Class, and Tissue. Different cell type (Class) has different combinations from each other.",
